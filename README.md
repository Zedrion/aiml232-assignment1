# AIML232 - Assignment 1
 
A collection of Python experiments exploring machine learning concepts, completed as a part of **AIML232** (2025) course projects.

A1.2: Explore the properties of high dimensional vectors using visualizations from matplotlib
A1.3: Explore the properties of linear projection and singular value decomposition (SVD) with numpy.linalg
A1.4: Explore linear regression methods using the gradient descent method and a from-scratch implementation of the pseudo-inverse method to calculate weights
